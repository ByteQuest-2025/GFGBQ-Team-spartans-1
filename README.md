Project Name - Lucid Trace
About the Project
Lucid Trace is an early-detection support system designed to identify silent and rare diseases by tracing subtle, often ignored symptoms that individually appear harmless but collectively signal serious conditions.
The project demonstrates this approach using **Alagille Syndrome**, a rare genetic disorder affecting the liver, heart, and other organs, which is frequently underdiagnosed due to variable symptom severity.
## 🎯 Problem Addressed
- Silent diseases are often missed in early stages  
- Symptoms are treated in isolation rather than as patterns  
- Late detection leads to irreversible damage  
Lucid Trace focuses on **pattern-based symptom analysis** rather than diagnosis.
